Hi, I'm Davide Bellone! I'm software developer with 7+ years of professional experience.

I'm currently employed as a senior backend developer in a private company in Turin, Italy.

I've been working with Microsoft platforms and frameworks since 2014: I started as a __SharePoint__ developer, then I moved to __ASP.NET MVC 5__, __.NET API__, __Angular 6__, and finally I became a __full backend__ developer.

I'm currently working with many tools and frameworks, like __Azure__, __RabbitMQ__, __MongoDB__, and __Docker__.

I love learning new things, and I think that the best way to learn is to share: that's why I started my journey as a content creator and conference speaker.

If you want to keep in touch, you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BelloneDavide)!
