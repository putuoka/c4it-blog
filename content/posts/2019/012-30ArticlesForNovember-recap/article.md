For this November I decided to share each day an article on Twitter.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;m gonna start a new challenge here on Twitter: my personal <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/30ArticlesForNovember?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#30ArticlesForNovember</a>. I&#39;ll share an interesting article from the sources I follow, so for example <a href="https://twitter.com/ThePracticalDev?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ThePracticalDev</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/CodeMazeBlog?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CodeMazeBlog</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/CsharpCorner?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CsharpCorner</a>.<br><br>Will you join me?</p>&mdash; Davide Bellone üêß (@BelloneDavide) <a href="https://twitter.com/BelloneDavide/status/1189474483503022081?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 30, 2019</a></blockquote> 


I did it for simple reasons:

* share great content with the Twitter community
* recognize author's work by sharing and promote it
* discover new things and see the world from a different point of view
* achieve the goal of reading __at least__ an article each day


Here's the recap:

<div style="text-align: center">

On November I did my best 

trying to share an article each day.

I completed my own quest, 

and here comes my links array.  

---

Most of them were on C sharp, 

on some things I thought were dull.

 went deep in, like in a scarp, 
with [indexers](https://csharp-station.com/Tutorial/CSharp/Lesson11 "Indexers"), [lazy](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/top-7-least-known-but-important-c-sharp-features/ "Important C# features"), [LINQ](https://blog.quadiontech.com/5-c-features-that-will-help-you-to-understand-linq-bca495cd3fb8 "LINQ") and [null](https://mikaelkoskinen.net/post/subtle-csharp-bug-null-conditional-operator-any-false "Subtle null bug").

 You can be a [string or a String](https://blog.paranoidcoding.com/2019/04/08/string-vs-String-is-not-about-style.html "string vs String"),
 
 it depends on your [namespace](https://medium.com/@morgankenyon/under-the-hood-of-c-alias-types-and-namespaces-82504a02660e "A namespace overview").
 
 [Returning null](https://odetocode.com/blogs/scott/archive/2019/08/07/think-twice-before-returning-null.aspx "Why returning null is a bad idea") is not a small thing, 
 
 just like [swapping vars in place](https://dev.to/mortoray/terrible-interview-question-swap-variables-without-a-temporary-22jp "how to handle technical interviews").
 
 ---
 
 To be or not to be?
 
 This is the question. 
 
 Will you use [Cosmos DB](https://dev.to/petereysermans/things-i-wish-i-knew-before-i-got-started-with-cosmosdb-4o05 "Introduction to CosmosDB")?
 
 Try [EF Core](https://www.thereformedprogrammer.net/an-in-depth-study-of-cosmos-db-and-ef-core-3-0-database-provider "EF Core vs Cosmos DB"), but pay attention.
 
 ---
 ¬´[Unit of work](https://gunnarpeipman.com/ef-core-repository-unit-of-work/ "Unit of work with EF Core")! I'll start from here¬ª, 
 
 or maybe Dapper, and something more?
 
 That's not obvious, I'll be sincere, 
 
 you might want [EF Core](https://exceptionnotfound.net/dapper-vs-entity-framework-core-query-performance-benchmarking-2019/ "EF Core vs Dapper benchmarking").
 
 ---
 [.NET Standard, Core and Framework](https://code-maze.com/differences-between-net-framework-net-core-and-net-standard/ ".NET versions differences"), 
 
 you can see them all in action. 
 
 Want performance? Want great work?
 
 Take care of [Garbage Collection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/memory "Garbage collection introduction").
 
 ---
 ¬´I wanna all remote! Remote [work](https://doist.com/blog/mental-health-and-remote-work "Remote working downside"), remote  [calls](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/grpc-vs-http-apis/ "gRPC vs Rest APIs")!¬ª. 
 
 If your boss allows it, just say ¬´Thanks!¬ª
 
 If not, don't break his balls.
 
 Be a nice person, just like [Tom Hanks](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/movies/tom-hanks-mister-rogers.html).

 My [source code is not a book](https://dev.to/snj/learn-from-source-code-4d1o "Source code readibility"), 
 
 [few comments](https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/opinion/opinion-pieces/fighting-evil-code-comments-comments/ "How to comment code") - lots of defects.
 
 [TDD](https://techblog.holidaycheck.com/post/2018/01/02/testing-code-that-isnt-there-yet "TDD examples"), I had a look.
 
 But, [only positive effects](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/exploding-software-engineering-myths/ "Software engineering myths")??

 Doesn't care if frontend or backend, 
 
 remember to test - don't leave that empty gap -
 
 [unit](https://blog.usejournal.com/lean-testing-or-why-unit-tests-are-worse-than-you-think-b6500139a009 "Downsides of unit testing"), [integration](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-tests "How to write great integration tests"), end 2 end, 
 
 and you'll create a better app.

 [Will you fail?](https://jamesclear.com/3-stages-of-failure "3 stages of failure") I can't tell.
 
 You must [plan your career with attention](https://medium.com/better-programming/you-need-to-design-your-programming-career-f3d0b9803ca4 "How to plan career"). 
 
 Ok, ya know [what is a shell](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/WhatsTheDifferenceBetweenAConsoleATerminalAndAShell.aspx "Shell vs Console vs Terminal")
 
 Something cool to talk [at a convention](https://dev.to/nspinazz89/12-tips-to-maximize-your-experience-at-a-tech-conference-5dkj "Tips for tech conferences").
 
 ---
 
 For 2020 I wanna speak at [another conference](/blog/advices-from-my-first-public-speech "My first speech experience"),
 
 and maybe [write with more regularity](https://www.ilonacodes.com/blog/most-common-blogging-mistakes-of-beginner-bloggers/ "Blogging common mistakes" ), 
 
 this will help me gain self-confidence,
 
 and [increase my blog popularity](https://dev.to/brandonskerritt/how-to-go-from-3-views-to-1-000-308-30a9  "Increase blog views").
